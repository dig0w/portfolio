                        <p>This was my first project: a Discord chat bot. After watching some tutorials, I decided JavaScript was the way to go. The objective of this bot was to play music in Discord voice channels, and it now supports music from YouTube, Spotify, and SoundCloud. Through this project, I learned about Node.js, APIs, and databases, specifically MongoDB.</p>

                        <p>After experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provided the most learning. This is a chat application, similar to WhatsApp. The front-end is built with React.js and uses Socket.io for real-time communication with the server. The back-end is developed with Express.js, and MongoDB is used to store user information. Additionally, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are implemented for secure authentication.</p>

                        <p>In just three months, I completed ten projects, which I consider quite an achievement. I started learning 3D modeling using Blender, motivated by my interest in eventually pursuing video game development.

                        <p>My first game was an FPS (First-Person Shooter) that took about five months to develop. It features a weapon system (fire and reload), grenades, two maps (both incomplete), and Steam online support. Afterward, I became interested in cars and decided to create a car racing game. The goal was to develop an open-world game where players could drive around and relax, but I only managed to get the car mechanics working, which took about two months (its really hard to make car physics in Unreal Engine).</p>

                    <h1>I guess I'm a software engineer</h1>
                    <p>
                        I am an 18-year-old from Portugal, and my passion for development began when I was 14. The 2020 pandemic left me with a lot of free time, so I decided to learn coding by creating a Discord chat bot using JavaScript. This initial project sparked my interest in development.<br>
                        <br>Following the chat bot, I created several websites, including a chat app and this portfolio. After a while, I felt the need for a new challenge and tried 3D modeling for about three months. It was an enjoyable experience, but I wanted more. So, with some savings, I bought a PC and began exploring video game development. I created an FPS game and a car racing game, but eventually, it got boring. That's when I returned to javascript, developing some chrome extensions to fix some problems, in several websites, bringing my journey to the present.<br>
                        <br>I'm looking forward to discover more about machine learning and AI, and finally learn some python. You can see most of my projects in <a href="https://github.com/dig0w">github</a>.
